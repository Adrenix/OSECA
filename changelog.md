## 1.18 (Universal) - Version 4.0.0
This is the first release build for Minecraft 1.18.
- Updated mod to Minecraft 1.18 universally for Forge and Fabric using [Architectury](https://github.com/architectury).
- Added new sound category to the option menu.
- Added new sound feature: Disabled attack sounds.
- Added new eye candy feature: Disabled item merging (will not work in multiplayer).
- Added new eye candy feature: Mob drops will no longer merge (connected to item merging option above).
- Added new eye candy feature: Drops from ores will no longer merge (connected to item merging option above).
- Added new eye candy feature: The Minecraft version will appear in the top left of the HUD like in beta/alpha.
- Added new eye candy feature: Brought back the old button hovering graphics.
- Added new animation feature: Disabled the subtle animation that occurs when trying to move while colliding with a block.
- Updated 2D item simulation by actually making the floating items look like they are in 2D.
- Updated configuration labels and tooltips to make it easier to read and understand what each option does.
- Fixed a bug that would make all entities in the world share the same arm swing speed as the player.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the camera to jitter while standing on a slime block.
- Redid the entire modded reequip animation logic. Now reequipping will function exactly as it did in the old days.

### Upcoming
- More sound, eye candy, and animation options will be added in later updates.
- Server support for features like item merging is something I want to do for a later update.
- Some (not all) of the new features will be back-ported to 1.16 (v2).
- Since 1.17 (v3) was 1.18 part 1, I will no longer be back-porting features to 1.17; however, bug fixes will be patched for 1.17.
- A minor update to 1.12 (v1) is planned to address the missing option hot-key and a few bugs.
