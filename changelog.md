# Fabric
Starting with Minecraft 1.17, this mod will support Fabric. The Forge branch will continue once a 1.17 build is ready.

## Version 3.1.1
This is a minor update that fixes an issue and adds a few new features that didn't make it in the initial release of the eye candy update.
- Added old tooltip boxes.
- Disabled the swinging animation when dropping items.
- Disabled the tool disintegration animation and breaking sound when a tool's durability runs out.
- Disabled the light flickering animation. It is recommended to combine this feature with an old lighting resource pack.

- Updated the config menu.
- Fixed a bug where pressing the O key while in an inventory would open the mod's config menu.
