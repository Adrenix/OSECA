This mod brings back the old swinging animations before Minecraft Beta 1.8. While this mod is an "eye candy" mod targeted towards nostalgic enthusiasts, it is also useful for those who are photosensitive since the mod is very configurable. For example, you can turn off the swinging animation entirely. Additionally, all the animations this mod changes can be toggled. Moreover, you can customize the swing speeds of swords, tools, items, and everything in-between!

## What Changes?
- The arm sway animation has been disabled. (Configurable)
- The cooldown animation that plays after every swing or change in slot has been disabled. (Configurable)
- The reequip animation no longer plays when an item damage value changes. (Configurable)
- The swinging animation has been slowed down. (Configurable)

The goal of this mod is to provide a swinging animation that has not been seen since Minecraft Beta 1.7. The result of these animation changes provide a smoother swinging experience which is easier on the eyes. Additionally, you can configure the swing speeds of categorical items or individual items.

If you are photosensitive, then this mod is the perfect solution for you. Since all swinging speeds are configurable, you can disable the swing speed animation entirely if that is what you need.

### Note
None of the animation modifications will change block breaking speed or combat. These changes are only visible to the client. Meaning only you can see the changes made by this mod. Potion effects that impacted the animation before still do.

#### Changelogs
To see the changes made across all versions, please see the [changelog](https://github.com/Adrenix/OldSwing/blob/master/changelog.md) file.

## Configuration
As an added feature, you can configure how fast - or slow - the swing speed animation is for any item in the game. That means if you prefer your sword swinging speeds to be fast and tool swinging speeds to be slow, you can do that. Even the placing speed animation for blocks can be changed if needed. Additionally, if motion sickness is of concern for you - or for an audience - I recommend setting the animation speed to 10 or higher. This will result in a slower and smoother swinging animation.

You can modify all configuration options in-game by opening the configuration menu. This is done by pressing the "O" key. The in-game configuration menu uses [cloth-config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config-forge) by shedaniel which is a required dependency.

If you are using Forge, then you can also open the configuration menu through Forge's mod menu. If you are using a Fabric, then you need to have the [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) mod installed.

As a last resort, you can always still edit configuration options through the config file. You need to restart the game to apply any new changes though.

## Demo Video
A new video will be released once new features are finished for 1.17.x.

## Compatibility
If you come across a compatibility issue, please let me know! It is best to create an issue if you come across one. You might also experience animation issues when using modded items that utilize the re-equip animation. If this is the case, you can turn off the oldswing reequip animation in the configuration menu.

## FAQ

### Can I include Old Swing in my pack?
Sure!

### Is this mod server safe?
Yes. This mod only changes visual animations and is client-side only.

### I ran into an issue running this mod.
Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/Adrenix/OldSwing/issues).

### The mod loaded, but some features are not working.
This means there is a mod conflict. A possible solution is to make sure the Old Swing loads last (or first) and see if that fixes the issue.
