This mod brings back the old swinging animations, some old eye candy, and some old animations throughout various previous versions of Minecraft. All changes can be toggled and swing speeds are heavily customizable. This mod is intended for nostalgic enthusiasts and those who are photosensitive. You can customize the swing speeds of swords, tools, items, and everything in-between!

## Forge & Fabric
Starting with 1.18, I'm now using [Architectury](https://github.com/architectury) to manage my project, so it is easier for me to build for both forge and fabric at the same time.
This means there will be little to no overlap in time between releases on a single MC version.
