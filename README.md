This mod brings back the old swinging animations before Minecraft Beta 1.8. This is an "eye candy" mod targeted towards nostalgic enthusiasts. As a bonus, this mod is also very configurable. All animation changes can be toggled. Moreover, you can customize the swing speeds of swords, tools, items, and everything in-between!

## Version 2.0.0
Old swing has been updated to 1.16! Hooray!
- Every change in the game is now configurable.
- Since Forge does not have an in-game config GUI yet, you can change these values with the `/oldswing` command.
  - You can also use the config file. After you save your changes, the game will automatically update without a restart.
- More old-school animations have been implemented.

## What Changes?
Only the animations will change. The goal of this mod is to provide a swinging animation that has not been seen since Minecraft Beta 1.7.
- The arm sway animation has been disabled. (Configurable)
- The cooldown animation that plays after every swing or change in hotbar slot has been disabled. (Configurable)
- The re-equip animation no longer plays when an item damage value changes. (Configurable)
- The swinging animation has been slowed down. (Configurable)

### Note
None of these animation modifications impacts block breaking speed or combat. Moreover, these changes are only visible to the client. Meaning only you can see the changes in animation. Potion effects that impacted the animation before still do.

## Configuration
As an added feature, you can configure how fast - or slow - the swing speed animation is for any item in the game. That means if you prefer your sword swinging speeds to be fast and tool swinging speeds to be slow, you can do that. Even the placing speed animation for blocks can be changed if needed. Additionally, if motion sickness is of concern for you - or for an audience - I recommend setting the animation speed to 10 or higher. This will result in a slower and smoother swinging animation.

You can modify all configuration options in-game with the `/oldswing` command. Unfortunately, this command will not be available in online multiplayer. However, you can still edit these configuration options within the config file. After you save the file, the new changes will automatically be applied in-game without a restart. Nifty!

## Commands
These commands come equipped with auto-completion.
- `/oldswing set` Used to change a config value.
- `/oldswing get` Used to get current values saved in the config.

## Compatibility
If you come across a compatibility issue, please let me know! It is best to create an issue if you come across one. You might also experience animation issues when using modded items that utilize the re-equip animation. If this is the case, you can turn off the oldswing reequip animation in the config or through the /oldswing command.

## FAQ
### Can I include Old Swing in my pack?
Sure!

### Is this mod server safe?
Yes. This mod only changes visual animations and is client-side only.

### I ran into an issue running this mod.
Please submit an issue.

### Will there be a backport to 1.15?
If there is a bit of demand for this, I will look into it since 1.15 is a LTS version for Forge.

### What about a backport of version 2 to 1.12?
There needs to be a lot of demand for this before I would consider it.
