This mod brings back the old swinging animations before Minecraft Beta 1.8. While this mod is an "eye candy" mod targeted towards nostalgic enthusiasts, it is also useful for those who are photosensitive since the mod is very configurable. For example, you can turn off the swinging animation entirely. Additionally, all the animations this mod changes can be toggled. Moreover, you can customize the swing speeds of swords, tools, items, and everything in-between!

## Version 2.2.2
This is a small feature update that adds a new animation option.
- Added a sweep particle animation option that will prevent the sweep particles from showing when attacking an entity with a sword.
- Updated the injection methods so that the mod will no longer crash the game when it conflicts with another mod.
> Note: If there is a mod conflict, then the mod may not work as expected.

#### Changelogs
To see the changes made in previous versions, please see the changelog file.

### Note
None of these animation modifications impacts block breaking speed or combat. Moreover, these changes are only visible to the client. Meaning only you can see the changes in animation. Potion effects that impacted the animation before still do.

## Configuration
As an added feature, you can configure how fast - or slow - the swing speed animation is for any item in the game. That means if you prefer your sword swinging speeds to be fast and tool swinging speeds to be slow, you can do that. Even the placing speed animation for blocks can be changed if needed. Additionally, if motion sickness is of concern for you - or for an audience - I recommend setting the animation speed to 10 or higher. This will result in a slower and smoother swinging animation.

You can modify all configuration options in-game with the `/oldswing` command or using the configuration menu. The configuration menu can be opened using the "O" key, through Forge's mod menu, or by using the `/oldswing config` command. Additionally, you can edit these configuration options within the config file. After you save the file, the new changes will automatically be applied in-game without a restart. Nifty!

## Commands
These commands come equipped with auto-completion.
- `/oldswing set` Used to change a config value.
- `/oldswing get` Used to get current values saved in the config.
- `/oldswing config` Used to open the configuration menu.

## Compatibility
If you come across a compatibility issue, please let me know! It is best to create an issue if you come across one. You might also experience animation issues when using modded items that utilize the re-equip animation. If this is the case, you can turn off the oldswing reequip animation in the config or through the /oldswing command.
