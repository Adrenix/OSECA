This mod brings back the old swinging animations before Minecraft Beta 1.8. While this mod is an "eye candy" mod targeted towards nostalgic enthusiasts, it is also useful for those who are photosensitive since the mod is very configurable. For example, you can turn off the swinging animation entirely. Additionally, all the animations this mod changes can be toggled. Moreover, you can customize the swing speeds of swords, tools, items, and everything in-between!

## Fabric
Starting with Minecraft 1.17, this mod will support Fabric. The Forge branch will continue once Forge 1.17 is released. See the [changelog](https://github.com/Adrenix/OldSwing/blob/master/changelog.md) to view what was changed for version 3.0.0.

## Mod Description
### What Changes?
- The arm sway animation has been disabled. (Configurable)
- The cooldown animation that plays after every swing or change in slot has been disabled. (Configurable)
- The reequip animation no longer plays when an item damage value changes. (Configurable)
- The swinging animation has been slowed down. (Configurable)

The goal of this mod is to provide a swinging animation that has not been seen since Minecraft Beta 1.7. The result of these animation changes provide a smoother swinging experience which is easier on the eyes. Additionally, you can configure the swing speeds of categorical items or individual items.

If you are photosensitive, then this mod will be the perfect solution for you. Since the swing speeds are configurable, you can disable the swing speed animation entirely if that is what you need.

## Configuration
As an added feature, you can configure how fast - or slow - the swing speed animation is for any item in the game. That means if you prefer your sword swinging speeds to be fast and tool swinging speeds to be slow, you can do that. Even the placing animation for blocks can be changed if needed. Additionally, if motion sickness is of concern for you - or for an audience - I recommend setting the animation speed to 10 or higher. This will result in a slower and smoother swinging animation.

To change animation states and swing speeds, you can open the configuration menu by pressing `o` key in-game. The configuration menu can also be accessed through Forge's mod menu. (If you are using Fabric, Old Swing does provide support for the [mod menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) API.)

If you are photosensitive, I recommend opening the configuration menu and accessing the `General Settings` page (`Swing Speeds` page in versions before 3.0.0). In this page, you can enable `Global Speed` and change the `Global Swing Speed` slider to `0`. This will disable the swinging animation entirely.

## Commands
Starting with Minecraft 1.17, the command system for this mod has been deprecated. Everything that you need is now in the configuration menu. This menu can be opened using the `o` key.

If you are using a version before 3.0.0, then the following commands are available to you. These commands come equipped with auto-completion.
- `/oldswing set` Used to change a config value.
- `/oldswing get` Used to get current values saved in the config.
- `/oldswing config` Used to open the configuration menu.

## Demo Video
New demo video will be coming soon to better showcase the mod in Minecraft 1.17.

## Compatibility
If you come across a compatibility issue, please let me know! It is best to create an issue if you come across one. You might also experience animation issues when using modded items that utilize the re-equip animation. If this is the case, you can turn off the oldswing reequip animation in the config or through the /oldswing command.

## FAQ

### Can I include Old Swing in my pack?
Sure!

### Is this mod server safe?
Yes. This mod only changes visual animations and is client-side only.

### I ran into an issue running this mod.
Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/Adrenix/OldSwing/issues).

### Will there be a Fabric backport to 1.16?
This depends on how easy it would be to backport from 1.17.

### The mod loaded, but some features are not working.
This means there is a mod conflict. A possible solution is to make sure Old Swing loads last (or first) and see if that fixes the issue.
