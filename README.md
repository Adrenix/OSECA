This mod brings back the old swinging animations before Minecraft Beta 1.8. While this mod is an "eye candy" mod targeted towards nostalgic enthusiasts, it is also useful for those who are photosensitive since the mod is very configurable. For example, you can turn off the swinging animation entirely. Additionally, all the animations this mod changes can be toggled. Moreover, you can customize the swing speeds of swords, tools, items, and everything in-between!

## Version 2.2.0
This is a major feature update with a focus on configuration menus. The mod now comes with a graphical user interface that allows changing mod configurations without commands. This menu can be opened in multiplayer. The default key to access this menu is 'o'. This key can be changed in the control settings menu.
- Added a configuration menu.
  - This can be accessed via the mods menu, the 'o' key, or `/oldswing config`
  - The config menu key can be used in multiplayer.
- Added a mod state toggle button.
- Added an animations sub-menu.
- Added a categorical swings sub-menu.
- Added a custom swing sub-menu.
- Added tooltips to all configuration buttons.
- All sub-menus can be reset to their default state.
- Language support is now in development.
- Increased compatibility with other mods.

To see this new major feature update in action, please see the new demo video.

### Version 2.2.1
This is a small update that should significantly increase compatibility with other mods.
- Changed the core codebase to utilize injections which should significantly increase mod compatibility.
- Modified reequip animation logic to help with mod compatibility.

#### Changelogs
To see the changes made in previous versions, please see the changelog file.

### Note
None of these animation modifications impacts block breaking speed or combat. Moreover, these changes are only visible to the client. Meaning only you can see the changes in animation. Potion effects that impacted the animation before still do.

## Configuration
As an added feature, you can configure how fast - or slow - the swing speed animation is for any item in the game. That means if you prefer your sword swinging speeds to be fast and tool swinging speeds to be slow, you can do that. Even the placing speed animation for blocks can be changed if needed. Additionally, if motion sickness is of concern for you - or for an audience - I recommend setting the animation speed to 10 or higher. This will result in a slower and smoother swinging animation.

You can modify all configuration options in-game with the `/oldswing` command or using the default configuration menu. This menu can be opened using the "O" key.

## Commands
These commands come equipped with auto-completion.
- `/oldswing set` Used to change a config value.
- `/oldswing get` Used to get current values saved in the config.
- `/oldswing config` Used to open the configuration menu.

## Compatibility
If you come across a compatibility issue, please let me know! It is best to create an issue if you come across one. You might also experience animation issues when using modded items that utilize the re-equip animation. If this is the case, you can turn off the oldswing reequip animation in the config or through the /oldswing command.

## FAQ
### Can I include Old Swing in my pack?
Sure!

### Is this mod server safe?
Yes. This mod only changes visual animations and is client-side only.

### I ran into an issue running this mod.
Please submit an issue.

### Will there be a backport to 1.15?
If there is a bit of demand for this, I will look into it since 1.15 is a LTS version for Forge.

### What about a backport of version 2 to 1.12?
There needs to be a lot of demand for this before I would consider it.
