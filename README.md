This mod brings back the old swinging animations, some old eye candy, and some old animations throughout various previous versions of Minecraft. All changes can be toggled and swing speeds are heavily customizable. This mod is intended for nostalgic enthusiasts and those who are photosensitive. You can customize the swing speeds of swords, tools, items, and everything in-between!

#### Fabric Port?
It is likely that I will develop a Fabric port of version 2 to 1.16.5 after porting the eye candy update.

Starting with Minecraft 1.17.x version 3 of this mod **does** support Fabric.

#### Changelogs
To see the changes made in previous versions, please see the [changelog](https://github.com/Adrenix/OldSwing/blob/1.16.5/changelog.md) file.
